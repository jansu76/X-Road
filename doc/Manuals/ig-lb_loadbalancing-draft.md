# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Target Audience

The intended audience of this installation guide are the X-Road security server administrators responsible for installing and configuring the X-Road security server software.
The document is intended for readers with a good knowledge of Linux server management, computer networks, database administration and the X-Road functioning principles.

# X. Overview

This document describes the external load balancing support features implemented by X-Road. For brevity, it will be called 
`XRLB` in the document. The supported setup consists of security servers in a cluster having an identical configuration,
including their keys and certificates. X-Road security server configuration changes are handled by a single master server.

The primary goal of the load balancing support is, as the name suggests, load balancing, not fault tolerance.
A clustered environment increases fault tolerance but some X-Road messages can still be lost if a security server node fails.

The implementation does not include the load balancer component. It should be possible to use any external load balancer
component that supports HTTP-based heath checks and load balancing at the TCP level (eg. haproxy, nginx, AWS ELB or
Classic Load Balancing, or a hardware appliance).

The `XRLB` is implemented with a few assumptions about the environment that users should be aware of. Carefully consider
these assumptions before deciding if `XRLB` is suitable for your needs.  
* Adding or removing nodes to or from the cluster is infrequent. \[**Mihin vaikuttaa?**\]
* Configuration changes are relatively infrequent and some downtime in ability to change configuration can be tolerated. Therefore, the cluster uses a master-slave model and the configuration master is not replicated.


The configuration master is a cluster member using which changes to the serverconf database and authorization and signing keys are applied. The replication is one-way from master to slaves and slaves should threat the configuration as read-only.
Cluster nodes can continue operation if the master fails but configuration can not be changed until the master becomes back on-line or some other node is manually promoted as master.
If a node fails, the messages being processed by that node are lost. 
It is the responsibility of the load balancer to detect the failure and route further messages to other nodes. Because there potentially is some delay before the failure is noticed, some messages might be lost due to the delay.
Recovering the lost messages is out-of-scope.
Configuration updates are asynchronous and the cluster state is eventually consistent.
If the master fails or communication is interrupted during a configuration update, each slave should have a valid configuration but the cluster state can be inconsistent (some members can have the old configuration while some might have received all the changes).

# 2. Installation

## 2.1 Prerequisites to setting up an external load balancer

The nodes that will be set up as slaves  


The central server software assumes an existing installation of the Ubuntu 14.04 operating system, on an x86-64bit platform.
To provide management services, a security server is installed alongside the central server.
The central serverâ€™s software can be installed both on physical and virtualized hardware (of the latter, Xen and Oracle VirtualBox have been tested).
Note: If the central server is a part of a cluster for achieving high availability, the database cluster must be installed and configured before the central server itself can be installed. Please refer to the Central Server High Availability Installation Guide [IG-CSHA] for details.
